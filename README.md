### üõ†Ô∏è Problem
In today's travel industry, many travelers miss out on enriching experiences due to a lack of detailed information about guided tours. Key issues include:
        
- Lack of transparency regarding tour itineraries, pricing, and tour type (private vs. shared).
- Inadequate communication channels between travelers and guides, leading to unanswered questions and uncertainty.
- Privacy concerns in group tours where travelers seek interaction but want to keep their personal information secure.

These issues cause dissatisfaction and often lead to missed opportunities for both travelers and guides. Recent surveys have shown a 30% decline in satisfaction with traditional tour booking processes.
